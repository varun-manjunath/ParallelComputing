# ParallelComputing

Hello!

In this repository, I will apply serial and parallel optimizations to existing open-source code. My aim is to apply the concepts of parallel processing to analyze programs and inculcate optimizations into them for efficiency and speed. I have also written my own programs to show you some interesting scenarios in computing algorithms and the caveats that surface while developing naive algorithms.

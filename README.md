# ParallelComputing

Hello!

In this repository, I will apply serial and parallel optimizations to existing open-source code. My aim is to apply the concepts of parallel processing to analyze programs and inculcate optimizations into them for efficiency and speed.I have also written my own programs to show you some interesting scenarios in computing algorithms and the caveats that surface while developing naive algorithms.
